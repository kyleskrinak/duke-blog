0:21:00 : the unique nature of LCHF, and eating to satiety, i.e., ad libitum. Low-calorie diets are difficult to maintain for this reason. They rarely last beyond 6 months.

0:24:30 The recalibration effect, which helps to set the body’s homeostatic point.

0:27:45 What is the Keto diet? Optimal fueling and signaling to the body. Limiting carbohydrates. You can overeat protein. Discussion on hunter cultures and diet. 

0:36:00 Balance of protein and ketosis.

0:38:45 Exercise/not exercise study. At 60% peak performance, burning around 700 calories a day. The body sensed it was in privation, slowed down metabolism, commensurate with energy need from exercising. Resting metabolic rate to the exercises decreased resting metabolism. No difference in weight loss. The body accurately calculated the difference between the requirement for exercise, and those that didn’t exercise. Satiety is all part of the same system.

0:49:00 An experiment on people with pre-diabetes and underlining insulin resistance. A prompt reduction in insulin resistance and improvement in biomarkers.

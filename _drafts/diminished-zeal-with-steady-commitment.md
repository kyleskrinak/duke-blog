## After 2+ years, the loss continues

Though my LCHF journaling has been quiet, don’t let my silence fool you. I have been thoroughly enjoying low-carb living and its consequences. My initial excitement was my finding actual validation in what I had read in Atkins diet books fifteen or more years ago. Even better, Dr. Westman’s guidance helped me exceed where my read of Atkins had failed. As I type this post, 2 years and 2 months in, I am maintaining my weight loss, increasing my health, and enjoying life as I had not expected at my age.

If all is so great, you might think my zeal would stoke my muse, that I’d write more. While I love to write, there’s a flipside to public professions. Someone I love dearly, changed her eating to a low-carb diet. She dropped 50 pounds and said she never felt better. “Why don’t you blog about it? You can inspire others to give it a go.” I asked. 

She responded; 

> “I’ve spent my whole life with my weight problem hovering over every aspect of who I am. I don’t want my weight, to be a ‘thing’ with me. I want it all behind me.” 

It didn’t hit me until a couple of days later what she was saying, and I love that reaction. Isn’t this how it should be? Our culture is drenched in a quasi-nutritional patter about fiber, cholesterol, exercise, how “bad” one is to want “one more pie,” and so on. We should eat, enjoy what we eat, and live. 

We should eat to live, not live to eat.

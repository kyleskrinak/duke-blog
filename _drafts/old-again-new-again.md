I was a magazine production manager in the early 90’s, in NYC. My business attire was a shirt and tie, which was common then and there. My having to wear a suit coat was optional. Then, life happened. My wife and I moved to North Carolina. We had a baby. Another baby. A third baby. I got older. My vocation adapted to changing markets. I got a job at Duke University. While I was always overweight to varying degrees, I had became, well, fat. Clinically obese.

My belly wasn’t built in one day. My 38" waist became a 40, 42 cresting at 44, though really should have been a 46". My XL shirts were tight around the belly. After years of gradual gain, putting on my old 90’s clothes was well out of the question. Defeated, I had carefully put my old clothes away in the hope that I would, one day, win the battle of the bulge.

This past weekend, I’ve decided that it was time. In the past, even with my most successful weight-loss efforts, I would have been back on the seemingly inevitable upward weight trajectory. However, this has not been the case. I am solidly in the low 220’s. I have been since January, 2018. I am enjoying my low-carb regimen. I see no reason to change how I eat.

My closet has been the battery for my old and new clothing. Last summer I had “mothballed” my XL+ shirts and 40+ pants. I’ve been buying replacement clothes from Goodwill.

LCHF has given me the confidence to spend time and money on my professional appearance.

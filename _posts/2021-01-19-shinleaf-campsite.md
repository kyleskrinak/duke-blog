A tall thick web of branch silhouettes cut the night sky. A few stars and a bright moon cut through, enough to dimly illuminate the forest around us. There was nothing extraordinary about it, other than the infinite richness around us. We were with other dads and daughters, and we all went for an ordinary walk at the camp site. Alexa and I walked hand-in-hand. Being with her friends excited her, being with me excited her; yet we were walking as if to get the mail.

When I was 8, I played alongside a lake, against a star-splattered night with my brother and sister. Kris showed me the Milky Way; Karen showed me the isthmus to an usually unreachable island. That was also an ordinary night, a night that now sneaks up and fills me in an extraordinary way.

For Alexa, that walk was just a brief moment between the scary campfire stories, marshmallow smores and watching and playing with the campfire.

For her dad, it was something else.

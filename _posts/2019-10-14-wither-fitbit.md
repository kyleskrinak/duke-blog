> What’s worse than a watch that nags you with bad advice? I don’t know, but that has the makings of a good joke. 

I’ve been a doting fan of [Fitbit](https://www.fitbit.com "Fitbit's home page") watches since I got one for Christmas several years ago. The Fitbit watch remains cheaper than the Apple Watch and calculates the main focus of my physiological concerns, if not obsession. This was a few years before I discovered low-carb eating. Way back then, I fully embraced the “Calories in, calories out,” or CICO. The premise of CICO is simple: don’t eat more calories than your body uses. Elementary, right? It’s all about the laws of physics, you science-denier. We’re not creating calories ex nihilo, right? 

It turns out that this simple explanation, CICO, is *too simple*. It was sufficiently simple, however, to lure a nation, and the first world, into very bad, *very terrible* nutritional advice.

Fitbit promised we users a helpful technological innovation towards a stubborn and tireless opponent — our obesity. Between rigid food journaling with [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/ "Link to MyFitnessPal") (MFP) and calorie tracking with Fitbit, I was set. I faithfully captured years of careful journalling, both automatically, since Fitbit reported my activity to Fitbit’s servers. As did MFP, I had a full daily, weekly, monthly, yearly accounting. Given the unassailable science behind CICO, what could go wrong?

## What went wrong

Everything went wrong, and nothing went wrong. All that data resulted in no change in health or weight. I was always under my “recommended” calories and exercised at least five times a week. I kept my fats low and fiber high. I had the habit, since I continued this practice for years, with nothing to show for it.

Then I started seeing Dr. Westman. With his guidance, I began a radical change to my diet. Dr. Westman is looking for long-term adoption and not the quick weight-loss pyrotechnics of “Greatest Loser” and other such shows. I told him I was tracking, which he gently cautioned against my doing so. I continued to track anyhow, because, hey, it’s data. I wanted to see supporting data for the change. That said, it was all time consuming: the morning weigh-in, tracking my meals, entering my exercise, and reviewing the day’s data. 

After switching to low-carb, I started to see a new warning on MFP, an admonishment that my meal was “high in saturated fats.” As you might imagine, this was on nearly every meal I tracked. I finally got tired of the nagging, and I dropped MFP. I will say, however, that the unique advantage of this tracking was developing a better sense of what foods had sugars and more carbs than I imagined. I stopped my routine monitoring and gained valuable time back in my life. 

After stopping my food tracking, I saw no negative impact on my health or weight control.

Recently, Fitbit has introduced its own nag feature. I get a bevy a garbage nutritional advice messages on my Fitbit app, which I see while I’m syncing my watch. Warnings about “Keep your fiber intake high” and “Keep your fat consumption.” See the pattern of lousy advice, everywhere? These obsequiously specious messages led me to reconsider the Fitbit as a personal lifestyle accessory and habit. Does it add unmerited complexity to my life?

## Now what?

There’s one way to find out, and that means that I stop wearing it. However, I am frugal, and I like the convenience of having the date and time available on my wrist. Given the generally poor manufacturing of Fitbit watches — nearly every watch I’ve purchased has had a manufacturing flaw — it’s a simple matter of time before I’ll need to replace it. Then I will drop the Fitbit. For what? I don’t know.

Oh, and I’ve started only to weigh myself once a week now. I love not stepping on that damn thing every morning.

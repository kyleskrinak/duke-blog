## Quote #2

## Quote #4

“For those who live in the world and desire to embrace true virtue it is necessary to unite together in holy, sacred friendship. By this means they encourage, assist, and lead one another to perform good things. Men walking on level ground do not have to lend one another a hand, while those who are on a rugged, slippery road hold on to one another in order to walk more safely.” —St. Francis de Sales


## Quote #5

“In this world two things are essential: life and friendship. Both should be highly prized and we must not undervalue them. Life and friendship are nature’s gifts. God created us that we might exist and live: this is life. But if we are not to remain solitary, there must be friendship.” —St. Augustine


## Quote #6

## Quote #8

“Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.” —John 15:13 (Jesus Christ)


## Quote #9

A friend is, as it were, a second self.” —Cicero

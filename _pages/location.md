My office is at [Brightleaf Square](http://historicbrightleaf.com/directions/ "Directions to Brightleaf Square"), **905 West Main Street, Suite 25B,** in bustling Durham, NC. Our office is on the second floor, right above the [“El Rodeo”](http://elrodeonc.com/brightleaf/ "link to El Rodeo menu") restaurant.

As of June 21st, 2019, Brightleaf Square has changed our parking options. Parking is now available off W. Main Street, between Gregson and Duke Streets, on the south side. The Chesterfield building, across on Duke Street, is also on the south side of W. Main.

We can provide our guests with parking vouchers. These vouchers will cover up to three hour's worth of parking. To take advantage of these vouchers, you will drive into the parking lot off W. Main Street and take your parking ticket as you enter the parking lot. Be sure to request a voucher before leaving our office. When you return to your car, first provide your ticket to the automated attendant and then present your voucher for scanning.
